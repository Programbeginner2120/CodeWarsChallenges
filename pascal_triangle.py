'''NOTE: I want to clarify that though this function does function properly and is mathematically sound, it does
not satisfy the unit tests for exceedingly large n arguments on codewars development environment. I have run the largest
n value given by the challenge and run it here, where it works fine and operates in the range of approximately 60-80 ms.
Though it's not technilcally "completed" on codewars, I'm posting it to this repo for the purpose of showing this works
despite the problems with the codewars embedded environment.'''
